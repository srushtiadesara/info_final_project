    "Ethics of Care: This framework focuses on the idea that we should balance the needs that we have and those of others. For this reason, this framework is relevant here because when we are assessing words, we should think about how they make us or those who will hear the words feel before we choose them. \n",
    "Utilitarianism: This framework says that the greatest good is the best choice. When considering social media and its wide impact it has, it's important to consider how people exposed to this content will feel. The best choice will be the content that promotes the most positive emotion. \n",

    "\n",
    "Is it always necessary to post only positive content or could this be argued as unethical? \n",
    "Kantian: Kantian framework argues that the morality of an action depends on whether it's done out of duty or the right intentions. To define the idea of duty in the context of social media, we can consider the terms and conditions of various platforms. This framework is relevant here because no one is obligated to post positive content, but they are obligated not to post negative content. According to this framework, the consequences are secondary. \n",
    "Utilitarianism: This framework suggests that the option that positively affects the most people is the best choice. This is relevant if we consider that posting only positive content harms a lot of people, which could be viewed as unethical. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Would there ever be an instance where seemingly negative content could be beneficial? \n",
    "Kantian: The Kantian framework argues that people should do the right thing even if it might have a negative impact. This is relevant because it goes to show that if someone has a duty to post something and it is not viewed as beneficial, this still might be argued as ethical since it was their duty. Alternatively, their intention may be considered. If what they posted was inherently negative, but their intention was good, this framework would deem the choice as ethical and beneficial. \n",
    "Ethics of Care: This framework focuses on the fact that we should balance our needs and those of others. There may be situations where content that is deemed negative, may be balancing our needs and the needs of others. While controversial, it may still be considered ethical. \n"
